//make sure you replace the name values with the same name so name1 cahnged to harrypotter would have to change all name1's to harrypotter also remember no spaces in
//in the name fields you may add more text lines by simply copying and pasting "after pressing enter to make it go down horizontally > "“text”", < as seen above
// can have as many as you want because of name2.length also note that command name will be what the user types and the line at the top where it says "= class name1" 
// should be the same as command name for effeciency can be different though aliases are what other names you can use to call command for example " aliases: ['stupe','mute','stupid fly'], "
// group is what the command would be under in >help so just leave it as 'quotes', membername: should be the same as name: just because it is easier to remember
// description is easy to remember it is just what you want the bot to say the command does in >help like 'rolls a die'
